File1: This file contains variables that take in a threshold number, the final product number, and a current multiplier. It then has a while loop that will compute the multiplication if the final product is less than the threshold. Lastly there are two print statements regarding the final product as well as the number that caused the product to exceed the threshold.

File2: This file contains a function that is taking a list of strings and returning a nested dictionary. There is a for loop that is looking at the length of the strings as well as the parity of the words in the list. The nested dictionary will print the length as well as the parity and the words that were chosen in the print statement.

File3: This file defines a function that will compute powers of a number and return a list of pairs. There is a list of number examples as well as a final empty list and then a for loop that will pair the final pairs of the numbers if the y value is greater than or equal to 0. Finally, there is a print statement that will print the final pairs of numbers.

File4: In this file it is first importing a random value and then creating a list of random values and sorting them. Then it is finding the indices that are less than or equal to x. Finally it is printing the sorted values, the value of x and the first matching index. There is an else statement in case there is no value of x that is greater than or equal to x.

File5: This file imports math and contains a function that will compare the area of two different circles. It checks that integers are being used as well as that the radii are positive. It finds the smaller and larger circles and then computes the percentage coverage.

File6: This file contains a function that will take in a list of numbers and then return a dictionary. The list of numbers is sorted in order and then looped through each value with a for loop. Another for loop is used to count any values that are less than the key and then the percentage is calculated and the final dictionary is printed.

File7: This file defines a function that will take seconds since midnight and verify that the seconds meet the proper requirements, convert them into the different time 
components as well as determine if they are 'AM' or 'PM' and lastly make it a 12 hour format.

File8: This file imports the pandas library and then creates a dataset that will then be used to create a DataFrame. A computed new column from multiplying two of the original rows is then added to the DataFrame.
